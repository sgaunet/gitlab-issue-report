## Project Status

üü® **Maintenance Mode**: This project is used by me to get a summary of what I've done on some projects every month or every sprint. I don't plan to add new features or to improve the tool a lot, it's a side project with low priority.

While we are committed to keeping the project's dependencies up-to-date and secure, please note the following:

- New features are unlikely to be added
- Bug fixes will be addressed, but not necessarily promptly
- Security updates will be prioritized

## Issues and Bug Reports

We still encourage you to use our issue tracker for:

- üêõ Reporting critical bugs
- üîí Reporting security vulnerabilities
- üîç Asking questions about the project

Please check existing issues before creating a new one to avoid duplicates.

## Contributions

ü§ù Limited contributions are still welcome.

While we're not actively developing new features, we appreciate contributions that:

- Fix bugs
- Update dependencies
- Improve documentation
- Enhance performance or security

## Support

As this project is in maintenance mode, support may be limited. We appreciate your understanding and patience.
