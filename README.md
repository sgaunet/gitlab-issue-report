## Configuration

2 environement variables can be set :

* GITLAB_TOKEN: used to access to private repositories
* GITLAB_URI: to specify another instance of Gitlab (if not set, GITLAB_URI is set to https://gitlab.com)


# Infos

* [Gitlab Issue API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/issues.html)
* This project uses the [official GitLab API client library for Go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/api/client-go)

# Development

This project is using :

* golang
* [task for development](https://taskfile.dev/#/)
* [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/)
* [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

There are hooks executed in the precommit stage. Once the project cloned on your disk, please install pre-commit:

```
brew install pre-commit
```

Install tools:

```
task install-prereq
```

And install the hooks:

```
task install-pre-commit
```

If you like to launch manually the pre-commmit hook:

```
task pre-commit
```

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for all functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with verbose output
go test ./... -v

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/render -v
go test ./cmd -v

# Run linter
task linter
```

Tests follow black box testing principles, focusing on public interfaces and ensuring all output formats work correctly.

## Project Status

üü® **Maintenance Mode**: This project is used by me to get a summary of what I've done on some projects every month or every sprint. While it's a side project with low priority, it has recently been enhanced with markdown output support.

While we are committed to keeping the project's dependencies up-to-date and secure, please note the following:

- New features are unlikely to be added (though markdown output was recently added)
- Bug fixes will be addressed, but not necessarily promptly
- Security updates will be prioritized

## Issues and Bug Reports

We still encourage you to use our issue tracker for:

- üêõ Reporting critical bugs
- üîí Reporting security vulnerabilities
- üîç Asking questions about the project

Please check existing issues before creating a new one to avoid duplicates.

## Contributions

ü§ù Limited contributions are still welcome.

While we're not actively developing new features, we appreciate contributions that:

- Fix bugs
- Update dependencies
- Improve documentation
- Enhance performance or security

## Support

As this project is in maintenance mode, support may be limited. We appreciate your understanding and patience.
